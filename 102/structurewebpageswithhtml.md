## HTML Basics

1. *What is HTML and why do we use it?*

   - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that is used to structure a web page and its content. By using HTML, you're able to add common elements such as hyperlinks, change fonts, italicize words, insert bullet lists, and even images. 

2. *What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?*

   - The opening tag `<>` and closing tags `</>`: Pay special attention to the forward slash before the closing element name  as this must be present to close the element.

   - The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

   - The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together make up the element.

3. *What is it called when you give an element extra information?*

   - In HTML, an attribute is a special instruction or additional information provided within the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. The attribute name describes what part of the element you want to modify, and the attribute value provides the specific information or setting for that specific part.

4. *What is a semantic element?*

   - An HTML semantic element is an element that conveys meaning or information about the structure and content of a web page to both browsers and developers. They also provide context and communicate the purpose of the content to people and computers.
