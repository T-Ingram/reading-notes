This topic is important because it teaches me what options I have to create a streamlined webpage. Depending on internet speed/strength, the data load of the page, and so many other factors, it may be preferable to opt into using local storage to help the developer achieve their goal and user to be satisfied with their experience. Also learning what limitations local storage has and the proper workarounds are crucial to delivering a successful final product.

### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

#### 1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

- When using local storage for a web application it can allow for an increase in web page loading efficiency. This is done by storing non sensitive information on the users local machine, therefore lightening the load of what needs to be pulled from the server. This also has the benefit of keeping passwords, usernames, shopping carts and the like saved for added user convenience.

#### 2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

- As developers, we should not store any sensitive information in local storage or else we open up the door for data breaches, hacks or exploitation. By keeping sensitive data from being stored on local storage, we help to minimize vectors for any unauthorized access attempts.

#### 3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

- Local storage can only store strings, but when an object needs to be stored using local storage, it's unable to do so. In order to get around this limitation, we can use the JSON.stringify() to convert an object into a string while still keeping its structure intact, which will allow it to be stored correctly on local storage. When we need to get this data from storage we are able to use the JSON.parse() method to convert it back to its original data type.

## Things I want to know more about.

I'd like to see a professional programmer or web developer in action and just sit and pick their brains regarding their journey, their ups and downs, and how they handled them. I would really enjoy having more contacts that are close by.
