### CSS Transforms

#### 1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

- The CSS transform property allows a developer to manipulate the element on the x, y and z axis. When used in combination with other values one can create depth, rotate, and distort the element.

#### 2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

- `.example-image {`
  `width: 200px;`
  `height: 200px;`
  `transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;`
`}`

`.example-image:hover {`
  `transform: scale(1.5);`
`}`

This could be used when wanting to allow the user to hover over an image  
in order to zoom in closer.
