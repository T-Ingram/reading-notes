This topic is important because psychological health is likely one of the largest contributors to societal health. Often, in the workplace, more ephasis is put on efficiency and production over psychological health. But really if psychological health is taken care of, then it's likely to result in more productive and efficient employees. It's important to be thought of as more than just a number.

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

#### 1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- A psychologically safe team needs each person to know that they are safe to express their feelings, that they are listened to and *heard*, and that each member of the team cares about their individual well being.

#### 2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

- I managed a small team of mechanics and utility workers. Everyone knew that we were all underpaid, overworked, and disregarded by upper management, which automatically lowered the team's morale. I had to evaluate what aspects I had control over and brainstorm how I could make a positive impact in my sphere of influence. I knew that as the leader, I had to model what I was expecting of my team. I was open and vulnerable about issues that I was struggling through so that my team could see I was a person just like they were. I had many meetings with my team where we would chat about problems we were having in work, outside of work, and I tried to foster a sense of worth and openness. I encouraged others to be respectful, offer wisdom, and laugh during these meetings and in their work encounters. This worked for my previous team in Texas and it worked again in Oregon. Although we were aware of the downfalls at our company, we knew that we were all supporting each other and that we were "in it" together. Because of this camaraderie, my team worked hard and kicked butt.


#### 3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- Speaking from experience, they are more productive because they're happier, they understand their part and how their actions directly contribute to the goal of the department and company, and they bring this positivity to other departments. This not only helps the company make more money, but also improves the image that's associated with the brand. It's basically a win for everyone.

## Things I want to know more about.

I'd like to know if Google has seen in improvement in employee retention since they completed their study. I would imagine/hope so but It'd be nice to see hard data supporting this.
