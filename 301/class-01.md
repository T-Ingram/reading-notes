Props and component-based architecture are critical to software development because they provide a modular and scalable approach to building programs. Props allow you to pass information between different parts of your code, allowing for seamless communication and adaptability. Component-based architecture enhances the organization and scalability of projects, making it easier to manage, reuse, and maintain code, ultimately contributing to more efficient software development.

### Component-Based Architecture

#### 1. What is a “component”?

- A componenant is reusable piece of software designed to do specific tasks. It's often referred to as a modular component because it can be scaled, offers flexibility, and allows for independent development.

#### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?

- Software components are designed to allow independence, reusability, scalability, interoperability, and data bundling.

#### 3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Component based architecture offers distinct advantages, such as, ease of maintenance, cost effective development, parallel development, flexibility and reusability.  

### What is Props and How to Use it in React

#### 1. What is “props” short for?

- In React, props is short for properties.

#### 2. How are props used in React?

- In React, props are used to pass attributes from a parent component to a child component. By doing this, the child component can access this data and enable the creation of resuable components within React.

#### 3. What is the flow of props?

- Props flow in a unidirectional flow from the parent component to the child component. It's also known as a one way flow which allows for a clear and predictable data flow. This all contributes to the scalability and maintainability of React applications.

## Things I want to know more about.

I want to know see some live use cases of React, props, and component based architecture to help with my overall understanding of the concept.
