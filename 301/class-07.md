Understanding Node.js and npm is crucial for web development as they provide tools and environments to build efficient and scalable applications using JavaScript. Pair programming promotes collaboration, improves problem-solving skills, and fast-tracks learning by working closely with peers on coding tasks, improving overall productivity and code quality.

### An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

#### 1. What is node.js?

- Node.js is a platform that lets you run Javascript code on your computer making it easier and faster to build web applications.

#### 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

- It's built into Chrome and allows it to interpret and render JavaScript code directly in the web browser.

#### 3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

- Node.js being a JavaScript runtime means it provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing developers to run JavaScript on servers or computers with all the ability of the V8 JavaScript  engine.

#### 4. What is npm?

- Npm stands for Node Package Manager. It's a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages on the computer's operating system. It easily allows the configuration for JavaScript and Node.js.

#### 5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

- Node.js V20.5.1

#### 6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- Npm 9.8.0

#### 7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

- `npm install -g jshint`

#### 8. What is node used for?

- Node.js is used to build web servers, APIs, desktop apps and more.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

#### 9. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- Increased efficiency, enhanced collaboration, learning from peers, building social skills, to better prepare for pair programming job interviews, and to get us acclimated so that we're "work ready".

#### 10. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

- Learning from peers has been the most beneficial for me. I am new and want to learn as much as I can and if someone else has a different way of approaching a solution, I'm all ears.

#### 11. How does pair programming work?

- Pair programming involves having a driver and a navigator. The driver does the actual typing and the navigator provides feedback and error spotting. There is constant communication back and forth between each roll.

## Things I want to know more about.

I'd like to shadow a professional software developer someday. I'd like to just examine what they do, how a normal day looks, what types of problems do they run into, things like that would be fun to know.
