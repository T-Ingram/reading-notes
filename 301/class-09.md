Understanding functional programming concepts teaches me to write code in a way that’s predictable and easier to test, improving overall performance and through the use of  modules. Learning about modules and using `require` in Node.js allows me to reuse code effectively, improving maintainability in our projects. These concepts are critical in building scalable software solutions and building essential skills.

### Functional Programming Concepts

#### 1. What is functional programming?

- It’s a programming method that focuses on functions as the primary building blocks of software and focuses on constructing code to avoid any unwanted side effects.

#### 2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- A pure function is a function that always produces the same output for the same input and doesn’t cause any unwanted side effects.

#### 3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

- Predictability, testability, performance, modular composition.

#### 4. What is immutability?

- Immutability refers to the data that is created becoming consistent throughout the program's lifecycle.

#### 5. What is Referential transparency?

- It means that you can swap out a piece of code and its result, and in doing so, the program will still work the same.

### Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

#### 1. What is a module?

- It's very similar to components in React.js. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be easily imported into other parts of a program.

#### 2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

- It is a module bundler that is used to import other modules into your existing code for use.

#### 3. How do we bring another module into the file that we are working in?

- We would use the `require` function. It could be written like this, `const moduleName = require(`module-name`);`

#### 4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

- First you have to define the variable or function you want to share, then you export them using `module.exports`.

## Things I want to know more about.

I would really like to be more comfortable with the terminology that is presented in this section. I get it when I look it up, but off memory...it's a little confusing.
