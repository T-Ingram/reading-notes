## What Is A Growth Mindset?

A growth mindset in its simplest form is telling yourself "I can do this" when you feel like throwing in the towel. Challenges are ever present in our daily lives, it's what we do when we come face to face with them that makes us grow or stagnate in our development. 

***Here are some reminders to help keep you in a growth mindset***

- Often the greatest rewards come after the greatest challenges.
- If other people can do it, so can I. 
- Asking for help doesn't mean your incompetent, it means you care.
