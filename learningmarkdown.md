# Learning Markdown Formatting Language

## Why Use Markdown?

First off, it helps to understand what Markdown is. Created in 2004 by John Gruber, Markdown was designed to be a simplified markup language that allows users to easily create and format text, websites, and documents. It carries a huge upside in that it's cross compatible with many different applications, further increasing it's utility. Markdown also works the same whether you have a Windows, Mac, or Linux operating system. Due to it's lightweight nature, ease of use, and interoperability features, it's no wonder why Markdown is such an obvious choice for coders to use.

## Working With Markdown

At this point you might be wondering, "So what can I do with Markdown?" Well, let's take a peak at some editing commands!

- If you want to create a heading in Markdown you simply type " # " then add your text. More " # " signs mean smaller headings with " ###### " being the smallest possible heading and " # " being the largest possible heading.
- Say you want to emphasize something, you'd likely want bold or italicised wording to convey this. **Bold** would be achieved by using " ** ** " or " __ __ " while *italics* would be displayed by typing " * * " or " _ _ " . <br>***Please note:*** Due to possible application inconsistencies, it's best practice to use asterisks as opposed to underscores.
- What would a good page be without links? To create a link you have mulitiple options. One way is to wrap the link text in brackets like this, " [ ] " and then using parentheses " ( ) " around the URL. You can also use Ctrl + K on Windows or Command + K on Mac.
- If you want to create a bulleted list you can use the symbols " - ", " * ", or " + ".

## Final Thoughts

In summation, Markdown is a user friendly formatting language that has earned its place as a simple yet effective tool for the web developer, note taker, and blogger alike. Now that you've learned some commonly used commands, go take Markdown for a spin and experience it for yourself!
